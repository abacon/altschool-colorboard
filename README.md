# Altschool Colorboard!

Sorry, lots of things are in progress. And I did everything the hardest way
possible. Shrug! 

On the plus side, things are nice and extensible. And react is fun.

## What's missing?

- Board persistence (partially implemented)
- Client-side routing (partially implemented)

## Running

```sh
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080
```
